# 
# This is the main function that tests the sprintf function

# The "data" segment is a static memory area where we can 
# allocate and initialize memory for our program to use.
# This is separate from the stack or the heap, and the allocation
# cannot be changed once the program starts. The program can
# write data to this area, though.
	.data
	
# Note that the directives in this section will not be 
# translated into machine language. They are instructions 
# to the assembler, linker, and loader to set aside (and 
# initialize) space in the static memory area of the program. 
# The labels work like pointers-- by the time the code is 
# run, they will be replaced with appropriate addresses.

# For this program, we will allocate a buffer to hold the
# result of your sprintf function. The asciiz blocks will
# be initialized with null-terminated ASCII strings.

buffer:	.space	2000			# 2000 bytes of empty space 
					# starting at address 'buffer'
	
format:	.asciiz "string: %5.5s\n%5.5s\n"# null-terminated string of 
					# ascii bytes.  Note that the 
					# \n counts as one byte: a newline 
					# character.
str1:	.asciiz "abcdefg"		# null-terminated string at
					# address 'str1'
str2:   .asciiz "abc" 			# null-terminated string at
                                        # address 'str2'
chrs:	.asciiz " characters:\n"	# null-terminated string at 
					# address 'chrs'

# The "text" of the program is the assembly code that will
# be run. This directive marks the beginning of our program's
# text segment.

	.text
	
# The sprintf procedure (really just a block that starts with the
# label 'sprintf') will be declared later.  This is like a function
# prototype in C.

	.globl sprintf
		
# The special label called "__start" marks the start point
# of execution. Later, the "done" pseudo-instruction will make
# the program terminate properly.

# putint writes the number in $a0 to the console
# in decimal. It uses the special command
# putc to do the output.
	
# Note that putint, which is recursive, uses an abbreviated
# stack. putint was written very carefully to make sure it
# did not disturb the stack of any other functions. Fortunately,
# putint only calls itself and putc, so it is easy to prove
# that the optimization is safe. Still, we do not recommend 
# taking shortcuts like the ones used here.

# because you will be doing some similar conversions
# in your own code.
